## w00t - Achievement Unlocked. Jan 2021 100%

Lessons learned

- It's good to have a reason, motivation, and support to do what I've been wanting to do (self-study)
- Habit beats quantity. Some days there may only be time for 5 minutes, but I'm making it a point to take those 5 minutes.
- As Scott B. mentioned, it's going to take actual coding to make this stuff stick. I immensely enjoy the videos, but the fragmented nature of watching bits and pieces spread throughout the month doesn't make for practical learning (applying what I've learned). I may consider ramping down the videos and spend a month working on projects. Perhaps I'll target March for this as I'd like to continue with Android and SQL videos.

## February 2021

- 02/01/2021 - Start section 3 - why recyclerViews are called recyclerViews (hint: it recycles views)
- 02/02/2021 - Continue section 3 - recyclerView adapters
- 02/03/2021 - Continue section 3 - wire up adapter, start on list item click handling
- 02/04/2021 - Finish section 3
- 02/05/2021 - Start section 4 - navigation drawer
- 02/06/2021 - Continue section 4 - lots of good hands on work as Android Studio now implements the navigation drawer in a slightly different way than the tutorial, which is outdated. Had to figure out how to add a new layout, where to associate it with the display (app_bar_main layout's `layout` property), and how to make it contstrain to the display area (set `layout_behavior` to `appbar_scrolling_view_behavior`)

- 2/11/2021 - Completed section 4
